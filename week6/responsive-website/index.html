<!--
Your website must include:

X •A navbar (this will be a single page website so functional links are not needed), header, footer, and a main section.
X •The main section must include at minimum:  image(s), text, list(s), and table(s). Feel free to add other elements as you see fit. Remember: coding is about practicing code!
X •At least 3 media queries (mobile, tablet, and desktop). Remember to use the mobile-first approach when styling this website.

You must use:

X •CSS grid for the layout, and at least one example of CSS flexbox for aligning elements
X •A google font (you will need to go to fonts.google.com (Links to an external site.) and get the url for a <link /> on their HTML page)
X •CSS style sheet (no inline styling)

Note: Don’t forget proper spacing (box model)

                    <p>Now eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour? You bred raptors? Check the vending machines. Dinosaurs eat man; woman inherits the earth. Ian, freeze! I bring scientists, you bring a rockstar. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should. Look at all the blood. T-Rex doesn't want to be fed. It's a Unix system, I know this! I hate this hacker crap!</p>
                    <p>You bred raptors? When you gotta go, you gotta go. Are these characters...auto...erotica? Remind me to thank John for the wonderful weekend. I can't get Jurassic Park back online without Dennis Nedry. Well, at least you're out of the tree. Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson.</p>
